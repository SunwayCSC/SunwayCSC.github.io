# <a id="AIO">All in one websites</a>

These are sites that cover a lot of topics; In fact, if you just looked at the sites in this section I'd reckon you'd be fine.

1) **[TryHackMe:](https://tryhackme.com/)** an extremely beginner friendly site that offers lessons in the form of rooms. They also have pathways, CTFs, annual events, and a very fun king of the hill mode you can play with your friends!

2) **[PicoCTF:](https://picoctf.org/)** a site that hosts challenge questions and an annual CTF. They don't exactly follow a lesson format, but it's a great site for practicing!

3) **[HackTheBox:](https://www.hackthebox.com/)** feels like a nice mix of tryhackme and pico. Lesson format with pathways; they use a form of currency though, so while you'll start off with free modules, you might want to pay eventually.

# <a id="prac">Practical rooms</a>

These are websites hosting labs that you can use for hands on practice. Most of these don't hold your hand too much, so feel free to search for a writeup if you get stuck for too long.

1) **[OverTheWire:](www.overthewire.org/wargames)** a classic site hosting a bunch of wargames, which you can access by connecting to each room through ssh. The wargames range from beginner friendly to more advanced rooms.

# <a id="db">Exploit and vulnerability databases</a>

Here are sites containing information about known exploits and vulnerabilities.

1) **[Exploit.db:](https://exploit-db.com/)** a really nice and comprehensive website containing a bunch of vulns. The search function is pretty good; this is all you'll need honestly.

# <a id="rev">Reverse engineering and binaries</a>

Here are some handy resources for learning reverse engineering.

1) **[Godbolt.org:](https://godbolt.org/)** is a cool website that you can use to explore how different compilers handle code and what assembly it produces. TIP: replace the g and the d in the url to get a completely different website that you can use to explore how different disassemblers work!

2) **[GEF:](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/)** a really nice addon to the GNU debugger that adds a ton of features while making it more user-friendly.
