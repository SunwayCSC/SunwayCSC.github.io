First post of the website! Originally I wanted to create this site to store useful links and resources, but I guess we could also use it to post about our events and stuff; it's not harmful at all to have a website, right?

I'm a member of the 2024 committee, but this page is dedicated to the original 2023 committee, who helped us so much by starting the club, training us, and even assisting us to this day. Shoutout to them!

The 2023 committee held a lot of events for the club, including:

**1) A member orientation**
